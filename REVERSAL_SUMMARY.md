### 1. **Git Reset**
- Reverted to commit `4ad496b` (before my changes)

### 2. **Deleted Problematic Files**
- Removed `src/mobile-layout-fixes.css`
- Removed `MOBILE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`

- Cleaned up any other temporary files with `git clean -fd`

### 3. **Restored Original Configuration**
- Your original `src/index.css` is back
